# Project 35: To-Do List Manager

### Objective:
Build a really cool to-do list manager. We are going to upgrade the last to-do list manager we created:

### Steps:
1. **Create a Menu**: Allow the user to view, add, or remove an item.
2. **Edit Item Text**: Enable the user to edit the text of an item on the list.
3. **Prevent Duplicates**: Ensure that the user cannot add duplicate items.
4. **Confirm Removal**: Double-check with the user if they really want to remove an item from the list before it is actually removed.
5. **Erase the To-Do List**: Give the user the option to completely erase the to-do list. (This should be achievable in one line of code!)
