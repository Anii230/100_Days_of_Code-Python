# Project 27: Character Generator

Welcome to your first video game creation. You will create a video game that generates a character's health and attack stats, along with an epic name for your character.

**Do not delete today's code. You will be building upon it on Day 28.**

### Steps:

1. **Character Creation:**
   - Write a subroutine to generate a character's first name and type (e.g., human, imp, wizard, elf).

2. **Health Stats Generation:**
   - Write a subroutine that multiplies random dice rolls to generate health stats using the formula:
   \[
   \text{Health} = \left(\text{dice}(6) \times \text{dice}(12)\right) / 2 + 10
   \]

3. **Strength Stats Generation:**
   - Write a second subroutine to generate strength stats using the formula:
   \[
   \text{Strength} = \left(\text{dice}(6) \times \text{dice}(8)\right) / 2 + 12
   \]

4. **Presentation:**
   - Present the data in a visually appealing menu using `time.sleep` and `os.system("clear")`.

5. **User Interaction:**
   - Wrap the game in a loop so the user can create another character.

### Bonus:

- Make it look epic with some cool formatting and timing.
