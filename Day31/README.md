## Project 31: Classic User Interface with F-Strings

For today‚Äôs challenge, you‚Äôll be creating two classic user interfaces using string manipulation, formatting, and f-strings.

### Task:
1. **Use print statements** and f-strings to create the UI.
2. **Avoid input statements** ‚Äì focus on using strings and variables to format the display.
3. **Optional**: Use a color-changing subroutine (similar to the one from Day 29) to add color.

### Example Interfaces:
#### Interface 1: Music Player

```plaintext
        = = = Music App = = =
üî•‚ñ∂Ô∏è    Radio Gaga
          Queen

prev
               next
                             pause
```
#### Interface 1: Welcome Screen for "ArmBook"

```plaintext
          WELCOME TO
       --  ARMBOOK  --
    Definitely not a rip off
       a certain other
      social networking site
         Honest.
