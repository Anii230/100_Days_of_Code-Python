# Project 13: Grade Generator

This project is going to take some time (and some hard thinking), but it will be brilliant once you have it working!

### Project Overview

You are going to ask the user to type in the name of a test, the maximum score they could receive, and how many points they received.

For example, the test could be called "Python Skills", the maximum score is 50 points, and the user receives 30 points out of 50 possible points.

### Steps to Follow

1. **Input Collection**:
   - Ask the user for:
     - The test name.
     - The maximum score possible.
     - The score they received.

2. **Percentage Calculation**:
   - Calculate the percentage of points the user received using:
     \[
     \text{percentage} = \left( \frac{\text{points received}}{\text{maximum points}} \right) \times 100
     \]
   - Round the percentage to 2 decimal places.

3. **Grade Assignment**:
   - Use `if`/`elif` statements to assign a letter grade based on the percentage.

4. **Display the Result**:
   - Show the user:
     - The percentage they scored.
     - Their corresponding letter grade.
   - Add emojis to celebrate good grades or use different colors to visually indicate good or bad grades.

### Example Grading Scale

| Letter Grade | Percentage Range |
|--------------|------------------|
| A+           | 90-100           |
| A            | 80-89            |
| B            | 70-79            |
| C            | 60-69            |
| D            | 50-59            |
| U            | Below 50         |

Feel free to use a different grading scale if you prefer.
