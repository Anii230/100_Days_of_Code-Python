 Day 39 Challenge

Once the word has been picked, the following things need to happen:

    Prompt the user to type in a letter.
    Check if the letter is in the word.
    If it does, output the word with all blanks apart from the letter(s) they've already guessed.
    Keep a running list of the letters they've used.
    Count how many times they've picked a letter that isn't in the word - more than 6 and they lose.
    Output a 'win' message if they reveal all the letters.
