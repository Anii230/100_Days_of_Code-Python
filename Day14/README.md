# Project 14: 2 Player 🪨📄✂️

Are you ready for your first **BIG** project?!

So far, you've learned:

- Input and output
- If/elif/else statements
- Basic mathematics
- Casting values as `float` and `int`

**WOW!** That's a lot in just 13 days. Today, you're going to build a classic **Rock, Paper, Scissors** game!

### Starting Point

Here’s some starter code to ensure that when you use input, each player cannot see what the other player typed:

```python
from getpass import getpass as input
```

## What to Do

- **Two Players**: You will have two players: Player 1 and Player 2.
- **User Input**: Players should input either:
  - **R** for Rock
  - **P** for Paper
  - **S** for Scissors
- **Game Logic**:
  - Use `if` statements (and possibly nesting) to decide:
    - Who won
    - Who lost
    - Whether it's a tie
- **Input Handling**:
  - Allow users to input their choice in **lowercase** or **uppercase** (e.g., `r`, `R` for Rock).
  - Gracefully handle incorrect inputs by prompting the player to enter a valid choice again.

## Make it Fun!

- Add **emojis** or **epic comments** as your players battle it out!
- Example: "Player 1 🪨 smashes Player 2 ✂️!"

## Game Flow

1. Prompt each player to make a choice (R, P, or S).
2. Compare their choices using `if/elif/else` statements to determine:
   - Winner
   - Loser
   - Tie
3. Display the result with fun commentary and emojis to make the game more exciting!
