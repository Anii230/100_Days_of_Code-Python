# Project 24: Infinity Dice

Let's build an infinity dice!

- Create subroutines that will roll a dice with any number of sides.
- Write a subroutine with one parameter to allow calling a function, such as `rollDice`.

## Example:
```
Infinity Dice ðŸŽ²

How many sides?: 600
You rolled 532

Roll again? yes
You rolled 102

Roll again? no
```
---

## Output:
