# Project 30: Reflect on Your Journey

Today's challenge is to create a program that asks for feedback on each of the 30 days of challenges! For each day:

1. **Prompt** the user to answer a question about their experience for that day.
2. **Rephrase** their answer into a full sentence that is **center-aligned** under the heading.

## Example

```plaintext
30 Days Down

Day 1:
Amazing

            You thought Day 1 was amazing.
Day 2:
so good that I bought the David plushie

              You thought Day 2 was so good...
```
