# Project 6: Build Your Own Login Program

Create a simple login program that provides a personalized experience based on the user's credentials.

1. **User Authentication**:
   - Implement a login mechanism where users must enter a valid username and password.
   - Upon successful login, display a personalized greeting message.

2. **Personalized Greetings**:
   - Write unique, custom greetings for at least three different users.
   - For example:
     - **Alice**: "Welcome back, Alice! Hope you're having a fantastic day!"
     - **Bob**: "Hey Bob, good to see you again! Ready for another productive day?"
     - **Charlie**: "Hello Charlie! Don't forget to check your to-do list today."

3. **Handling Invalid Users**:
   - Include an `else` statement to handle users who shouldn't be logging in.
   - Display a generic message such as: "Access denied. Please check your credentials."

Here is the output of the program:
