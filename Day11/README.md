# Project 11: How Many Seconds Are in a Year?

Instead of Googling the answer, let's break it down and build a program to calculate how many seconds are in a year.

### Key Information:
- 60 seconds = 1 minute
- 60 minutes = 1 hour
- 24 hours = 1 day
- 31 days = 1 month
- 12 months = 1 year
- 365 days = 1 regular year
- 366 days = 1 leap year (every 4 years)

### Steps:

1. **Break Down the Problem**:
   - You can multiply all the necessary units (seconds, minutes, hours, days) to determine how many seconds are in a regular year and a leap year.

2. **User Input**:
   - Ask the user if the year they want to calculate is a leap year.

3. **Conditional Logic**:
   - Use an `if` statement to add an extra day for leap years (i.e., 366 days).

4. **Do the Math**:
   - Let the computer handle the calculations by multiplying the correct values.

5. **Output the Result**:
   - Display the total number of seconds in the year.
