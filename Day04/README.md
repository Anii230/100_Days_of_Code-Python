# Project 4: Story Time ðŸŽ­

Everyone loves a good story!

In this project, you will create an interactive adventure story that places the user as the main character. Customize the story based on their input to make it truly unique and engaging!

## Your Task

### 1. Gather User Input
Ask the user to provide some information about themselves. You can get as creative as you want with your prompts! Here are some ideas:
- **Things they like** (e.g., favorite color, hobby)
- **Things they dislike** (e.g., food they hate)
- **Names of family members or friends**
- **A place they would love to visit**
- **An imaginary petâ€™s name**

*Remember to keep it wacky and fun!*

### 2. Create the Story
Using the variables from step 1, construct a creative and engaging story. Hereâ€™s how you can do it:
- **Build the story one paragraph at a time** using the gathered information.
- Insert the userâ€™s input in different parts of the story to make it personalized.

### Sneaky Extra Skill
You can make your story more engaging by adding some color. Use colored text to emphasize certain parts of the story or to highlight key elements.
- For example, you can use ASCII escape codes in the terminal to change text color.
- Keep your creativity flowing, and letâ€™s make this story visually appealing too!
