# Project 36: Name storage

## Objective:

1. Create a list of people's names. Ask for first and last name (surname) separately.
2. Strip any extra spaces.
3. Store names in a capitalized version.
4. Create a new string using an f-string that combines the tidied-up version of the first name and tidied-up version of the last name.
5. Add those new versions to a list.
6. Do not allow duplicates.
7. Each time you add a new name, you should print out the full list.
