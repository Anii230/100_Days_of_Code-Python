# Project 33: To-Do List Manager

**Create your own To-Do List Manager** (This can be super useful!)

1. **Ask the user** if they would like to:
   - **View** the to-do list.
   - **Add** an item to the to-do list.
   - **Edit** the to-do list.

2. If the user chooses to **view** the list:
   - Print the list in a nice format.
   - **Hint**: Use a subroutine to keep the code organized.

3. If the user chooses to **add an item**:
   - Prompt the user to enter the new item.
   - Add the new item to the **bottom** of the list.

4. If the user chooses to **edit the list**:
   - Ask which item they completed.
   - **Remove** the item from the list.

5. **Additional Notes**:
   - Donâ€™t worry about duplicate items!
   - Use **FIFO (First In, First Out)** logic: the first item you add should be the first one you remove.
   - Show off your skills by adding a **title**, some **color**, **alignment**, or even **emojis** to make the interface more engaging!
