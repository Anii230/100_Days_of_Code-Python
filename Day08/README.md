# Project 8: Affirmations (or Insults) Generator

Today's focus is on using all the skills you have learned so far:

- Input and output
- Concatenation
- If statements
- Nested if statements

## Objective

Build a custom affirmations generator to give the user a personalized affirmation each day of the week.

### Requirements:

1. Ask the user for:
    - Their name
    - The current day of the week
    - A few of their favorite things

2. Use this information to build customized affirmations.

3. The goal is to generate a **unique message** for each day of the week based on the user's input.

4. Use **concatenation** to generate the affirmations.

### Optional Twist:

If affirmations aren't your style, you can generate a daily joke or light-hearted insult instead! (Keep it fun, not mean.)

---

### Final Challenge:

Can you create `if` statements that ignore capitalization (i.e., handle both uppercase and lowercase letters in names)?
