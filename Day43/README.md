Today's challenge is to create a bingo card. Oh yes, because programming's not just for you hip, young cats. ðŸ˜†

Anyway, your challenge is to enable "gambling for the elderly" (aka Bingo), and you'll achieve it like this:

    Randomly generate a series of number between 0 and 90.
    Allocate each number to a place in a 2D list.
    The numbers should be in numerical order, left to right.
    Numbers should not be repeated.
    The center square should not contain a number. It should contain the word 'BINGO!'.
    When the program is run, the bingo card should be displayed on screen.
