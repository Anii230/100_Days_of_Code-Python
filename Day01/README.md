## Project 1: Print into the World

Let's get started with your first project! After only one day, you already have something you can share with the world.

You can continue to use this same repl for your project. Just make sure you delete any previous code from our practice session.

### Instructions

1. **Write your full name and today's date** in separate lines of code.

2. **Print the following text:**

I am signing up for Replit's 100 days of Python challenge! I will make sure to spend some time every day coding along, for a minimum of 10 minutes a day. I'll be using Replit, an amazing online IDE so I can do this from my phone wherever I happen to be. No excuses for not coding from the middle of a field!

3. **Add another line** that says:
`I am feeling ðŸ˜„` (or use any emoji that represents your current mood).

4. **Add one more line to your output:**
`"Replit Sucks!"`

5. **Run your program**.

Here's a screenshot of my program output:
