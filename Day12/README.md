# Project 12: Debugging

The following code is full of errors. Let's try to fix it.

### Original Code:

```python
print("100 Days of Code QUIZ")
print()
print("How many can you answer correctly?)
ans1 = ("What language are we writing in?")
if ans1 == "python":
  print("Correct")
else:
  print("NopeðŸ™ˆ
ans2 = input("Which lesson number is this?")
if(ans2>12):
print("We're not quite that far yet")
else:
  print("We've gone well past that!")
elif(ans2==12):
  print("That's right!")
```

### Output:
