# Project 37: Star Wars Name Generator

## Objective:
Create a program that generates a Star Wars name based on user input.

## Steps:
1. **Get User Input**:
   - Ask the user for their first and last names.
2. **Generate Star Wars First Name**:
   - Slice the first 3 letters of the first name.
   - Slice the first 3 letters of the last name.
   - Join them together and format the case using either f-strings, `.upper()`, or `.lower()` to make it look good. This combined string is the user's Star Wars first name.
3. **Generate Star Wars Last Name**:
   - Ask the user for their mother's maiden name and the city where they were born.
   - Slice the first 2 letters of the maiden name.
   - Slice the last 3 letters of the city name.
   - Combine them and format the case for consistency. This is the user's Star Wars last name.
4. **Display the Result**:
   - Print the Star Wars first and last names as part of a fun sentence.
