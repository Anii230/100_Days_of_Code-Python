# Project 25: Character Generator

Let's extend Day 24's project and create a health stats generator for a character in a video game.

- Create a subroutine that rolls a dice of any size and returns that number.
- Then, create a second subroutine that rolls one six-sided dice and one eight-sided dice.
- Multiply the number from the six-sided dice and eight-sided dice together to return that as a character's health stats for a video game.
- Print out the character's health stats.
- Add a loop to allow the user to generate health stats for another character.

### Bonus Challenges:

ðŸ¥³ Extra points:
- Ask for the character's name.
- Double extra points for using different colors!
