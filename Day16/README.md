# Project 16: "Name the Lyrics" Game ðŸŽ¶

## Instructions

Create a game where users have to guess the missing words from your favorite song lyrics. The goal is for them to fill in the blanks with as few attempts as possible.

### Example

```plaintext
Fill in the blank lyrics!
(Type in the blank lyrics and see if you are as cool as me.)

Never going to ______ you up.
put
Nope, try again.

Never going to ______ you up.
let
Nope, try again.

Never going to ______ you up.
give

Well done! It only took you 3 attempts.
```

# Steps for the "Name the Lyrics" Game ðŸŽ¶

1. **Display the Song Lyrics**
    - Present the user with a portion of the lyrics, but with a word or two missing.
    - Use blanks (e.g., "______") to indicate the missing part.

2. **Prompt the User**
    - Ask the player to fill in the missing words.
    - Example prompt: "Never going to ______ you up."

3. **Track the Number of Attempts**
    - Keep count of how many guesses the player makes.
    - Each incorrect attempt should increment this count.

4. **Provide Feedback**
    - After each guess:
        - If the answer is wrong, respond with:
          `"Nope, try again."`
        - If the answer is right, respond with:
          `"Well done! It only took you X attempts."`

5. **Make it Fun!**
    - Add playful elements:
        - Use emojis ðŸŽ‰, ðŸŽ¤, or ðŸ’¡.
        - Include funny or encouraging comments for each incorrect guess.
        - Optionally, give the player hints after several wrong attempts.
