## Project 3: The Ultimate Wacky Recipe Maker

We have learned enough skills for a simple, but cool, project!

Remember when you were a kid and thought the ideal dinner would just be all your favorite things mixed in a bowl? How did that Nutella Mac & Cheese taste? Well - let's come up with a recipe generator to build us an amazing dish for today's evening meal!

### Instructions

1. **Create Variables:**
    - Create variables for the following:
        - A type of food
        - A type of plant
        - A method of cooking
        - A word to describe burned food
        - A household item

2. **Concatenate the Recipe:**
    - Use the variables to output a dish in this format:
      ```
      cooking food with burned plant on a bed of item
      ```

### Extra Challenge (Optional)

- **Remix the recipe:** Add more variables and make it even wackier! Why not create a full recipe for a starter, main course, and dessert?

Here's a screenshot of my program output:
